SRP/DRY check: Pass — centralizes prompt definitions away from runner orchestration.

  "4. Update Models: After each experiment, record precise state deltas (changes in grid, health, score). Update your rules, promoting LIKELY rules to CONFIRMED when repeatedly supported or revising them on contradiction.",
  "5. Plan with Options: Instead of thinking only in single-step actions, define small macros or options (go_to, collect_key, apply_pattern_sequence). Use your rules to simulate or reason through candidate plans, then choose the one with the best expected outcome under the step and health budget.",
  "6. Execute and Monitor: Execute your chosen plan step-by-step. After each action, re-check whether the observed state matches your prediction. If it does not, treat this as evidence your model is incomplete and return to the experiment-and-update phase.",
