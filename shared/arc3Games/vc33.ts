  description: 'Manage white columns as a liquid system to transport player squares to objectives.',
  mechanicsExplanation: 'The white columns function like liquid or water within a closed system. Clicking red or blue controller squares causes the "liquid" to flow from one contained area to another. Large player squares (yellow, green, purple) cannot be manually selected; instead, they automatically move when the path is cleared. If a player square is sitting on a white column, it will rise or fall with the column height, similar to a person sitting on top of a tube of liquid.',
